# Feature Specification: Expand MCP Tools via Loco Bindings

**Feature Branch**: `002-loco-bindings-mcp`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "将项目中其他的命令行工具也通过loco bindings来实现为mcp tools"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Catalog all command-line utilities currently shipped with the product
   → Identify purpose, ownership, frequency of use, and existing automation coverage
2. Prioritize which utilities must become MCP-accessible first
   → Consider team demand, operational risk, and compliance requirements
3. Define desired MCP tool behaviors for each CLI utility
   → Required inputs/outputs, context metadata, expected safeguards
4. Surface open questions or policy needs per utility
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] until resolved with stakeholders
5. Validate user scenarios and testing expectations for MCP interactions
   → Confirm parity with current CLI experience
6. Finalize functional requirements and entity definitions at the business level
7. Run review checklist and confirm readiness for planning handoff
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- Maintain parity with existing CLI experiences while reducing manual terminal usage
- Prioritize workflows that deliver measurable productivity or compliance gains
- Preserve clear ownership and operational guardrails for each converted tool
- Communicate scope boundaries for tools not yet ready for MCP conversion

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: 对于需要交互式输入的 CLI 工具，MCP 版本应如何处理？ → A: 支持，但需额外定义提示与响应流程
- Q: 对于目前需要高权限凭证的 CLI 工具，迁移为 MCP 工具时应如何处理认证？ → A: 沿用现有的自动化服务账号，MCP 工具不再提示实时凭证
- Q: 在确定哪些 CLI 工具优先迁移为 MCP 工具时，主要的排序依据是什么？ → A: 以团队日常使用频率最高者优先
- Q: 对于需要人工确认步骤或多阶段交互的 CLI 工具，MCP 版本应如何呈现这些流程？ → A: 拆分为多个 MCP 工具，每个步骤单独调用
- Q: 对于会产生超大输出或长时间运行的 CLI 工具，MCP 工具应采取什么策略？ → A: 设定超时并在超时后强制终止执行

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Operations engineers want to execute previously terminal-only maintenance commands from within the MCP workspace so they can work inside the unified assistant environment without context switching or copy/paste risk.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a supported CLI utility already documented, **When** an engineer requests it through the MCP interface, **Then** the corresponding MCP tool is discoverable with clear usage guidance and returns results equivalent to the original command.
2. **Given** multiple CLI utilities mapped through loco bindings, **When** a governance reviewer inspects the MCP catalog, **Then** each tool shows ownership metadata, guardrails, and last verification date aligned with policy.

### Edge Cases
- When a CLI utility requires interactive prompts or credentials, the MCP tool must script the prompts and responses, exposing guidance so users know the interaction flow.
- How does system handle commands that exceed expected execution time or generate large output payloads?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Program MUST deliver an authoritative inventory of CLI utilities eligible for MCP conversion, including rationale for inclusion or exclusion.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide MCP-accessible descriptions for each converted utility that outline purpose, required inputs, and expected outputs.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to trigger supported CLI behaviors through MCP while receiving feedback on execution status, interactive prompt guidance, and results visibility.
- **FR-004**: System MUST define governance hooks (ownership, review cadence, rollback path) for every MCP-exposed utility.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure parity checks so that MCP tool outcomes match the original CLI behavior within agreed tolerances.
- **FR-006**: Program MUST依据 CLI 工具团队日常使用频率来排序迁移优先级，并记录相关依赖及审批人。
- **FR-008**: System MUST将包含人工确认或多阶段交互的 CLI 流程拆分为独立的 MCP 工具步骤，以确保每次调用均获得明确的用户确认。
- **FR-009**: System MUST针对长时间运行或超大输出的 CLI 调用设定可配置超时，并在超时后终止执行同时告知用户。
- **FR-007**: System MUST在敏感 CLI 工具的 MCP 执行中复用现有自动化服务账号，确保不会向用户提示实时凭证，并保留调用审计记录。

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CLI Utility Profile**: Business description of each command-line tool, including purpose, business owner, risk rating, and parity expectations.
- **MCP Tool Listing**: Catalog entry that surfaces the MCP-accessible representation, including usage guidance, guardrails, and review metadata.
- **Execution Assurance Record**: Evidence log tracking validation runs, expected outputs, deviations, and escalation contacts for each tool.
