# Phase 0 Research: Loco-MCP Technical Analysis

**Research Date**: 2025-10-03
**Objective**: Validate technical feasibility and establish implementation approach for high-performance MCP server

## Research Findings

### 1. Rust-Python Integration Architecture

**Decision**: Use PyO3 with Maturin for Rust-Python bindings

**Rationale**:
- PyO3 is the most mature and well-supported solution for Rust-Python interoperability
- Maturin provides streamlined build process and Python wheel generation
- Direct function calls eliminate serialization/deserialization overhead
- Zero-copy data structures possible for optimal performance

**Alternatives Considered**:
- CFFI: Higher overhead, more complex error handling
- JSON-over-stdio: Added latency, complex protocol management
- gRPC: Overkill for in-process communication

### 2. MCP Protocol Implementation

**Decision**: Use claude-agent-py-sdk for MCP server implementation

**Rationale**:
- Official SDK ensures protocol compliance
- Built-in tool registration and parameter validation
- Simplified error handling and response formatting
- Community support and regular updates

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom MCP implementation: Higher maintenance burden
- Raw JSON-RPC: More complex error handling

### 3. Loco-rs Generate Command Architecture

**Decision**: Extract and refactor loco-cli generate functionality into library

**Rationale**:
- loco-rs already has well-tested generate functionality
- Refactoring maintains compatibility with existing CLI
- Library approach enables both CLI and programmatic usage
- Preserves all conventions and templates

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Create `loco-gen-core` crate with generate functionality
- Maintain CLI as thin wrapper around core library
- Expose structured functions for model, controller, and scaffold generation

### 4. Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: In-process execution with direct function calls

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates process startup overhead (~1-2 seconds per call)
- Avoids CLI argument parsing and text output processing
- Direct memory access for file operations
- Bypasses shell interpretation and subprocess overhead

**Performance Targets Validation**:
- Target <10ms response time: Achievable with direct function calls
- <1% failure rate: Robust error handling and input validation
- File I/O operations are the primary bottleneck, not processing

### 5. Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Structured error propagation with descriptive messages

**Rationale**:
- PyO3 provides automatic Rust Result to Python exception conversion
- Structured error types enable precise error handling
- File operation errors include context and suggestions
- Maintains compatibility with loco-rs error patterns

**Error Categories**:
- Validation errors: Invalid model names, field types, etc.
- File system errors: Permission issues, disk space, etc.
- Template errors: Missing templates, invalid syntax
- Configuration errors: Invalid loco-rs project structure

### 6. Security Considerations

**Decision**: Directory sandboxing and input validation

**Rationale**:
- Restrict file operations to current working directory
- Validate all inputs before processing
- Prevent path traversal attacks
- Maintain loco-rs project isolation

**Security Measures**:
- Path validation and canonicalization
- File permission checks
- Input sanitization for model names and field types
- Operation logging for audit trails

## Technical Architecture Validation

### Component Interaction

```
Claude Code Agent
       ↓ (MCP protocol call)
loco-mcp-server (Python)
       ↓ (direct function call)
loco-bindings (Rust via PyO3)
       ↓ (file system operations)
loco-rs project files
```

### Data Flow

1. Agent sends MCP request with structured parameters
2. MCP server validates and forwards to Rust binding
3. Rust binding processes generate command
4. File system operations create/modify files
5. Structured response with file lists returned
6. Agent receives structured feedback for next actions

### Performance Characteristics

- **Function call overhead**: ~0.1ms
- **File generation**: 1-5ms (depending on complexity)
- **Response formatting**: ~0.1ms
- **Total expected**: 2-8ms per operation

## Implementation Feasibility Assessment

### Technical Risks: LOW
- PyO3 is mature and well-documented
- loco-rs generate functionality is proven
- MCP protocol is standardized

### Performance Risks: LOW
- Direct function calls eliminate major bottlenecks
- File I/O is predictable and bounded
- Memory usage is minimal

### Compatibility Risks: LOW
- Maintains existing loco-rs conventions
- Uses standard Python packaging
- Compatible with existing development workflows

## Development Environment Requirements

### Build Tools
- Rust 1.70+ (for PyO3 compatibility)
- Python 3.11+ (for modern type hints)
- Maturin 1.0+ (for build automation)
- uv 0.1+ (for environment management)

### Dependencies
- PyO3 0.20+ (Rust-Python bindings)
- claude-agent-py-sdk 0.1+ (MCP server)
- serde 1.0+ (serialization)
- tokio 1.0+ (async runtime)

### Testing Requirements
- cargo test (Rust unit tests)
- pytest (Python integration tests)
- Performance benchmarks (<10ms validation)
- Contract compliance tests

## Conclusion

The technical approach is validated and feasible. All major components have proven solutions, performance targets are achievable, and implementation risks are low. The two-component architecture (Rust bindings + Python MCP server) provides optimal performance while maintaining flexibility and compatibility with existing development workflows.

## Next Steps

1. Extract loco-rs generate functionality into reusable library
2. Implement PyO3 bindings for core generate functions
3. Create MCP server with tool definitions
4. Implement comprehensive testing strategy
5. Performance validation and optimization
