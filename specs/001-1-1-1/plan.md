**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-1-1-1/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✅ No NEEDS CLARIFICATION found in spec
   → Project Type: single project (Rust + Python integration)
   → Structure Decision: two-component architecture
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   → ✅ Constitution check completed
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ No violations detected, all principles aligned
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check: PASS
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ Research completed, all technical decisions made
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
   → ✅ Design phase completed
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✅ Post-design constitution check: PASS
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Loco-MCP is a high-performance in-process MCP server that provides Claude Code Agent with fast, reliable programmatic access to loco-rs scaffolding functionality. The solution consists of two main components: (1) loco-bindings - a Rust library with Python bindings using PyO3 for direct access to loco-rs generate functionality, and (2) loco-mcp-server - a Python MCP server that exposes these functions as structured tools. This architecture bypasses CLI overhead entirely, targeting <10ms response times and <1% failure rates while maintaining full compatibility with loco-rs conventions.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Rust 1.70+, Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: PyO3 (Rust-Python bindings), Maturin (build tool), claude-agent-py-sdk (MCP server), uv (environment management)
**Storage**: File system operations (loco-rs project files)
**Testing**: cargo test (Rust), pytest (Python), integration tests for MCP tools
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
**Project Type**: single project with dual-language components
**Performance Goals**: <10ms response time for generate operations, <1% failure rate
**Constraints**: Must restrict file operations to current loco-rs project directory, must be compatible with loco-rs v0.3.0
**Scale/Scope**: Individual developer workflows, small to medium project scaffolding

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Constitutional Compliance Analysis

**I. Convention Over Configuration**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- Design follows loco-rs conventions for file generation
- MCP tool semantics align with existing CLI patterns
- Preserves loco-rs project structure and naming conventions

**II. Feature-Driven Modularity**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- Rust binding library provides optional functionality via Python interface
- MCP server component is separate and can be used independently
- Core functionality remains lightweight with minimal dependencies

**III. Comprehensive Testing Discipline**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- Plan includes unit tests for Rust bindings, Python integration tests
- Contract tests for MCP tool interfaces
- Performance validation tests for <10ms requirement

**IV. Performance-First Design**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- In-process execution eliminates CLI overhead
- Direct Rust function calls via Python bindings
- Zero IPC overhead by design

**V. Developer Experience Focus**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- Natural language interface through Claude Code
- Structured error messages and file operation feedback
- Maintains familiar loco-rs workflows

**Architecture Standards**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- Clear module boundaries between binding library and MCP server
- Well-defined interfaces with structured input/output
- Centralized error handling with descriptive messages

**Development Workflow**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- Code quality standards maintained for both Rust and Python components
- Comprehensive testing strategy outlined
- Documentation standards followed

**Structure Decision**: Two-component architecture with separate Rust binding library and Python MCP server. This design maximizes performance (Rust core) while providing flexibility (Python interface). Components are independently testable and maintainable.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - ✅ All technical decisions resolved
   - ✅ Performance targets clearly defined
   - ✅ Integration approach established

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - ✅ PyO3 best practices for Rust-Python bindings researched
   - ✅ MCP protocol implementation patterns investigated
   - ✅ loco-rs generate command architecture analyzed

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:
   - ✅ Technical decisions documented
   - ✅ Implementation approach validated
   - ✅ Performance feasibility confirmed

**Output**: ✅ research.md with all technical decisions resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - ✅ Model generation entities defined
   - ✅ Field validation rules specified
   - ✅ File operation entities identified

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - ✅ MCP tool contracts created
   - ✅ Binding interface contracts defined
   - ✅ Error handling contracts specified

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - ✅ Test schemas defined for all interfaces
   - ✅ Performance test contracts created
   - ✅ Integration test scenarios outlined

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - ✅ Model generation test scenarios
   - ✅ Controller/view generation test scenarios
   - ✅ Complete CRUD workflow test scenarios

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - ✅ Agent context updated with new technology stack

**Output**: ✅ data-model.md, /contracts/*, test definitions, quickstart.md, updated agent context

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Rust bindings before MCP server
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations detected - no complexity tracking required*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
